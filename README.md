## Penguin classification


The project involves a classification problem in supervised learning, employing various classification methods. The dataset contains 344 observations from the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin dataset. This dataset includes measurements of three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Features in the dataset encompass both categorical variables (Sex and Island) and numerical variables (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass). The goal is to accurately classify the penguin species based on these features.
